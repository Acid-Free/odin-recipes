    <h1>Roasted Brocolli</h1>
    <img src="brocolli.jpg" alt="Roasted brocolli on a plate">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Simple and tasty. I used half a bag of Costco Broccoli and cut each floret in half. Tossed in olive oil on the baking sheet and then arranged them cut side down (flat side down). Add Salt and Pepper. Baked for 20 minutes at 425. The flat side will brown on the pan and the top side gets a crispy crunch. Super yummy."</p>
    <p>"Our favorite way to cook broccoli. To the broccoli florets and olive oil, we add about a tablespoon of minced garlic and use Montreal Steak Seasoning rather than salt and pepper. I toss all in a plastic bag, give it a good shake, then spread it over the baking sheet prior to baking. I'm going to try the parmesan cheese addition next time I cook this. I just shake olive oil into the plastic bag, but feel I use at least double the amount listed so that it gets over all the florets."</p>
